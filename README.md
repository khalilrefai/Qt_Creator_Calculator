# Qt_Creator_Calculator

This project is a simple, functional calculator application built using Qt Creator, leveraging the Qt framework for the graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The design focuses on an intuitive layout with clearly labeled buttons for digits (0-9), operations (+, -, ร, รท), a clear button (C), and an equals button (=) to display the result.
